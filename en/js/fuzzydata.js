Plan Type Security settings are the second level of the permission hierarchy. See Set Up Plan Type Security for instructions on how to set up Plan Type Permissions Users whose security group has global permission of 'Administrator' are exempt from the Plan Type Security, meaning they can bypass the security and still create a plan. Users whose security group is without global 'Add Plan' permission will not be able to add\/see the add plan buttons in the first place, so this setting does not apply to them. So, the users whose security group has the global 'Add Plan' permission will be the ones affected by the Plan Type Security feature. How this feature works for affected security groups: If certain security groups are listed\/specified in the Plan Type Security settings: Only users whose security group is specified can freely create plans of this plan type. What about users whose security group has 'Add Plan' permission, but the security group is not listed in the plan type security settings? Then these users can create plans of this type only if they have contributor or owner access (via the Plan Share With settings) to the parent plans. Example: If you have a plan type hierarchy of Portfolio > Program > Project and security is placed at the Project plan type, you will still be able to create a 'Project' plan type only if you have contributor or owner access to the parent plans. The user will be prompted to select a Portfolio and Program, and if they do not have contributor or owner access (via the Plan Share With settings) to any Portfolios or Programs, then they will not be able to select them and therefore won't be able to proceed with the 'Project' creation.

The cards also display some general information about the project or epic, including the Benefits , Budget , Business Unit , and Prioritization Score . At the bottom of each card, you can see a bar displaying the project or epic overall % Done , how many days the project has been in a particular stage, and a color-coded dot representing the project or epic State (out of the box, light gray = Proposed, blue = Active, yellow = On Hold, dark gray = Closed). There is also a speech bubble icon you can click to add comments for a project or epic. The lines connecting different cards on the board represent dependencies between various projects or epics. The direction of the arrow shows the direction of the successor\/predecessor relationship, with the arrow pointing at the predecessor. The color of the line represents the method of the relationship, with blue lines representing regular dependent relationships, and red lines representing blocker relationships.

All of the board configuration settings are available here in the board header. New Plan : Click to create a new plan in your Portfolio. If you create a new plan from the board view, it may not display on the board immediately, as the new plan will likely not fit into the board view configuration. If you would like to view the new plan on the board, you need to go to the Portfolio List view, locate the new plan, and update the plan information so it fits into the columns and lanes of the board. Column : Select the plan field want to use for the columns in the board. For example, I will click on the Column menu, and select Goals from the drop-down. Now the Goals plan field will be used for the columns in the board. Lanes : Select the plan field want to use for the lanes in the board. For example, I will click on the Lanes menu, and select Program from the drop-down. Now the board will have swim lanes to group the cards by the Program they belong to. Color By : Select the plan field want to use to color-code the cards on the board. For example, I will click on the Color By menu, and select Overall Health. Now the cards on the board will be color-coded by the project or epic Stage . Totals : Select the plan field want to use as the column totals. For example, I will click on the Totals menu, and select Benefits from the drop-down. Now the column total value is a sum of the Benefits values of all of the projects and epics in the column. Plan Type : Select the plan types you would like available on the board as cards. For example, I will click on the Plan Types menu, and in the drop-down, you can see that I could display Portfolios , Programs , Projects , and Epics . These are the different plan types that are available in the My Portfolio area currently. Here I will select Projects and Epics . This means that all of the cards on the board represent a project or epic from my portfolio of work. Filter : Select plan fields to use as filters to limit the number of items that appear in the board. For example, I might set a filter on the Status field, and only load in projects and epics that have a Status of On Track . In the screenshot below, you can see the board with the Status > On Track filter applied. Notice that the Filter icon is highlighted blue. This means that there is a filter applied. To remove the filters, simply click on the Filter icon, then select Clear Filters (the first option in the Filter drop-down). This will remove all filters. Zoom : Select the size of the cards on the board. Options here include Small , Medium , and Large . Large is the default size. Small cards look like this: Medium cards look like this: Large cards look like this: Constraints : Set the constraint values for the columns in the board to run some light what-if scenarios. The constraints are based on the value you selected for the Totals . So, in the example I've been using throughout this article, the Totals , and thus the Constraints , are based on the Benefits values of the projects and epics in the board. To set constraints in the board: Click on the Constraints icon, the Edit [Selected Totals] Constraints form will open. Select the Constraint Goal. Options include None , Above Constraint , or Below Constraint . Because in this example I am working with Benefits as my Total values, I want to be above the constraint value I will set, as more benefits from projects and epics = more money for the organization. So, I will select Above Constraint . Set the constraint values for each column. Again, I am working with Benefits in this example. So for each column, I want to set the minimum benefits I want to see from all of the projects and epics in a column. To set these constraint values, click into the Constraint field for each column, and enter the desired value. Once the constraints are all set, click Save . Now, when you hover over the column title, you can view the column Total value compared to the column Constraint value to see if you are hitting your goals. Fields : Select the plan fields you would like displayed on the cards on the board. Out of the box, the Benefits, Budget, Business Unit, and Prioritization Score fields are displayed on the cards. For this example, I will also add the Funding Available and Overall Health fields to the cards. To do this, click on the Fields icon, then select the desired fields (Funding Available and Overall Health ) from the drop-down. The data from the selected fields will now be displayed on the cards on the board. " },

Click Widgets in the Portfolio header, then select Prioritize to enable reordering of the plans in your Portfolio. The Prioritize function will allow you to drag and drop to reorganize the currently selected top-level plan types in the Portfolio. So, for example, you could reorder the Portfolios in your My Portfolio view in your desired order. Here, I want to reorder my list of Portfolios, and have the Brand Management Portfolio moved from the bottom of the list to just before the Capital Investment Portfolio. To do this, I will click the Prioritize icon, and you will see a # column appear in the view. This means the Prioritize function is active and I can rearrange my list. Next, I will select the Brand Management Portfolio and drag it to the spot just before the Capital Investment Portfolio. When I let go of my mouse, the Brand Management Portfolio is now located before the Capital Investment Portfolio. I can now turn off Prioritizing and continue managing my Portoflio as usual. The Portfolio Prioritize function is a light version of what-if-ing. We recommend using the Modeler to do more robust prioritization and what-if-ing.

Lower-level plans are NOT filtered. Only top-level plans are filtered. Select a plan field to filter on. Set up the filter parameters. The filter parameter fields in the filter configuration will be generated dynamically based on the field type of the plan field you selected. Number and Currency fields : If you are filtering on a Number or Currency field, you need to select whether you want the resulting plans to have that field value less than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), greater than or equal to (>=), or equal to (=) the set value. Then enter in the value you want to filter your plans on. For example, I could set up a filter to view plans that all have a Budget greater than or equal to $500,000. That filter would look like this: Choice and Multi-Choice fields : If you are filtering on a Choice or Multi-Choice field, select the choice value(s) you want to filter your plans on. For example, I could set up a filter to view plans that belong to the IT and Operations Business Units. That filter would look like this: Date fields : If you are filtering on a Date field, select the date range you would like to filter on. You can select whether you want to filter plans that have a date value before a set date or after a set date. You can also check the Today check box to filter plans either before or after the current date. For example, I could create a filter to view plans that were created before April 1, 2024. That filter would look like this: User fields : If you are filtering on a User field, select the User you would like to filter on. You can also check the Me check box to filter for plans where you are the user for the selected field. For example, I could set up a filter to view plans that were created by Erlich Bachman. That filter would look like this: Yes\/No fields : If you are filtering on a Yes\/No field, select whether you want to see plans where the selected field value is Yes or No. For example, I could set up a filter to view plans where Funding Available equals Yes. That filter would look like this: Text fields : If you are filtering on a Text field, enter the text value you would like to filter on. For example, I could set up a filter to view plans that have Names including the word \"improve\". That filter would look like this: You can set up multiple filters.

"body" : "This article explains the features and functionality of the OnePlan Portfolio Modeler Kanban Board. OnePlan Portfolio Modeler Board is a visual tool used to create various \"what-if\" scenarios of plans within a portfolio. The board includes a series of columns and\/or lanes that represent the different stages or phases of the plan lifecycle, and it can be used to display information about each plan, such as the plan name, owner, status, budget and more. When using the Kanban in the modeler, all the changes made are \"what-if\" changes that do not affect plan data. This could be used to organize plans into different lanes and columns (for example program increments, releases, quarters, etc.). When you do this, you can add constraints to each column to model how you could organize your plans while staying within your selected constraint (for example points, hours, or budget). " },

"body" : "The first time you load the Kanban, the plans will be ordered based on the priority set in the list view. Only plans marked as \"in\" will be shown in the Kanban. All of the board configuration settings are available here in the board header. Column : Select the plan field want to use for the columns in the board. For example, I will click on the  Column  menu, and select  Goals  from the drop-down. Now the  Goals  plan field will be used for the columns in the board. Lanes : Select the plan field want to use for the lanes in the board. For example, I will click on the  Lanes  menu, and select  Product  from the drop-down. Now the board will have swim lanes to group the cards by the  Product  they belong to. Color By : Select the plan field want to use to color-code the cards on the board. For example, I will click on the  Color By menu, and select Overall Health . Now the cards on the board will be color-coded by the project or epic  Overall Health . Totals : Select the plan field want to use as the column totals. For example, I will click on the  Totals  menu, and select  Benefits  from the drop-down. Now the column total value is a sum of the  Benefits  values of all of the projects and epics in the column. Filter : Select plan fields to use as filters to limit the number of items that appear in the board. For example, I might set a filter on the Status field, and only load in projects and epics that have a Status of On Track. Zoom : Select the size of the cards on the board. Options here include Small, Medium, and Large. Large is the default size. Constraints : Set the constraint values for the columns in the board to run some light what-if scenarios. The constraints are based on the value you selected for the Totals. So, in the example I've been using throughout this article, the Totals, and thus the Constraints, are based on the Benefits values of the projects and epics in the board. To set constraints in the board: Click on the Constraints icon, the Edit [Selected Totals] Constraints form will open. Select the Constraint Goal. Options include None, Above Constraint, or Below Constraint. Because in this example I am working with Benefits as my Total values, I want to be above the constraint value I will set, as more benefits from projects and epics = more money for the organization. So, I will select Above Constraint. Set the constraint values for each column. Again, I am working with Benefits in this example. So for each column, I want to set the minimum benefits I want to see from all of the projects and epics in a column. To set these constraint values, click into the Constraint field for each column, and enter the desired value. Fields : Select the plan fields you would like displayed on the cards on the board. For this example, I will also add the Funding Available and Overall Health fields to the cards. To do this, click on the Fields icon, then select the desired fields (Funding Available and Overall Health) from the drop-down. The data from the selected fields will now be displayed on the cards on the board. " },

"body" : "The scheduling mode (also called task type) is a mathematical formula used by the OnePlan work plan to automate scheduling as you build and adjust your work plan. The scheduling mode calculation uses three task values: Duration : How long the task will take. Measured in days by default. Effort : How many total hours are estimated to do the task. Default effort is 8 hours Effort = 1 day Duration. Units : The percent a resource is allocated to a task. Default 100% allocation of one resource = 8 hours Effort, or 1 day Duration. Duration, Effort, and Units are all based on the calendar applied to a given task. The default calendar is set to 1 day = 8 hours = 100% allocation for 1 day, with a 40 hour work week. However, you can apply custom calendars which can change these values, and thus change the Duration, Effort, and Units calculations in the work planner. The scheduling mode defines which task properties are fixed (provided by user) and which ones should be calculated. You may set the scheduling mode at the plan level, which will set the default for each new task in your plan, or change individual tasks as needed. There is also an Effort Driven setting that fixes the task effort value. When set, it tells the event to preserve its effort value and recalculate the other properties. At the plan level, scheduling mode is referred to as the Task Type . See How do I add the Default Task Type field? to add the Default Task Type field to your OnePlan group. When you set the scheduling mode \/ task type at the plan level, all new tasks added to the plan will automatically be set to the selected scheduling mode \/ task type.

Please create a schedule in the configuration page\". Your OnePlan administrator needs to configure and enable the Task Notification schedule in the OnePlan configuration page. Click Add Notification , and the Add Notification form will open. Complete the Add Notification form. Complete the What section of the form. Select a trigger from the Trigger drop-down. Options include When a Field Changes or When a Date Passes . The form changes dynamically based on your choice. If you select When a Field Changes , two additional fields and a check box will appear. First, select a field from the Select a Field drop-down. When there are changes to the selected field, a notification will be triggered. Next, set a value in the Value field. This field will either be a number field or a drop-down based on the field you selected. This setting will trigger the notification when the field value is set to the selected value. If you want a notification to trigger when the selected field changes at all (you do not care about the value it changes to), leave the Value field blank and check the Any Value checkbox. If you select When a Date Passes , one additional field will appear. Select a date field from the Select a Field drop-down. When the date in the selected field passes, a notification will be triggered. (Optional) add filters to your notification. If you would like to further refine the tasks that will trigger a notification, you can add filters. For example, you only want a notification to trigger when a task is 50% complete and is At Risk. Select a field to filter on from the drop-down. The filter parameters will dynamically appear once you select a field. Select an inequality from the drop-down. Options in this drop-down will change based on the field selected, but will always include Equal and Not Equal . Select a value to filter from the drop-down. This field will either be a number field or a drop-down based on the field you selected. This setting will filter tasks when a field value is set to the selected value. As of December 15, 2023, Work Plan notifications can be filtered based on the milestone field. This is helpful if you only want to trigger a notification on milestones in your work plan. Complete the Notification section of the form. Select when the notification will send an email to the set recipients from the When drop-down. Options include Immediately (will send out a notification once the trigger parameters are met and will only send the notification once), Daily (will send out the notification once the trigger parameters are met, and will continue to send out the notification once a day until the task has been updated) and Weekly (will send out the notification once the trigger parameters are met, and will continue to send out the notification once a week on the specified day until the task has been updated). If you select Weekly , the Day of Week field will appear. Select the day of the week you want the notification to be sent to the recipients. Select the notification recipients from the To drop-down. Options include Owner(s) of Plan (will send the notification to all users with Owner permissions in the plan's Share With form), Field (will send the notification to users based on the Work field selected), Specific User (will send the notification to the specific user(s) selected), and Specific Team (will send the notification to the users who are part of the selected team(s)). If you select Field , the Select Field field will appear. Select the Work field to set the recipients of the notification. Options here include Assigned Resources . If you select Specific User , the Select User field will appear. Select the desired user(s) you want to receive the notification. If you select Specific Team , the Select Team field will appear. Select the desired team(s) you want to receive the notification. Enter a subject for the notification email. (Optional) select the Work fields that you would like to include in the notification email. This will append the selected fields and their values to the bottom of the notification email.

Video Length - 1:46 Now that you have worked with your team and stakeholders to create an agree on the Project's schedule. It's time to start executing the plan before you start tracking actual progress against the plan a common best practice is to save a baseline of the original plan. A baseline is a snapshot of the original project schedule based on the initial understanding of how the project will be delivered by the project team. The reason it's important is because it's like a handshake between the project manager team and stakeholders. Once you have a baseline in place. You can determine how well the project is performing versus the original plan. Out of the box, OnePlan saves the following five fields for each task to the baseline: % Done : % Done tracks percent complete. Remember the percent done in an original baseline should be zero percent because no actual progress is tracked at this point in the schedule. Start Date Finish Date Effort : Effort is typically measured in the estimated hours needed to complete the task. Remaining Effort : Remaining effort is how many hours are left once work starts on the tasks. Because there should be no associated actuals when an initial baseline is saved, remaining effort should equal the estimated effort. That way, you can track your actual progress against the original plan to determine how the project is performing at the task level as well as overall project performance. To save a baseline of your entire project schedule (or all of the tasks in the schedule), See Save a Baseline for All Tasks for instructions and more information. To save a baseline of a few selected tasks, see Save a Baseline for Selected Tasks for instructions and more information. " },

The other baselines are important because they are then used for historical purposes to compare the project performance against the current Baseline. Click Save . You will be asked if you want to save the current Baseline. Click, Yes , and then OnePlan saves the Baseline. We also recommend saving an additional baseline (Baseline (1) in this example). Baseline (1) now becomes something that you can save for historical purposes. Additional baselines give you that history that you'll be able to save, should you encounter situation where you need to rebaseline and then at that point you would use Baseline (0) to be the baseline for taking another snapshot of your schedule.

With the versioning function, you can save a new version of your plan, open a previous version of your plan, and restore an earlier version of your plan you are working on (which will overwrite your current work with the selected version). When you create a version of your work plan, the work plan structure, resources, tasks, and task data are saved.

"body" : "Here we see Resource Plan Cost Types. Resource Plan Cost Types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply. The Committed Hours cost type would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. The Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type.

To set up resource managers, see How do I set Resource Managers?. The resource manager pre-filter is a server-side filter that loads resources into the Resource Plan area and\/or Resource Center area based on user permissions and Resource Managers admin settings. Owners and Managers Users with Owner or Manager permissions can view all resources in their OnePlan group, and can use the pre-filter to narrow down the list of resources in the Resource Plan area. The pre-filter is based on the Method set in the Resource Managers settings. For example, Owners or Managers who are set as resource managers using a Business Unit method, the users will see a Business Unit filter in the Resource Plan area. Contributors Users with Contributor permissions do not have access to other resources in their group. However, as a resource manager, Contributors can see the resources they manage in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area.

"body" : "[video] This article explains resource cost types used in the OnePlan Resource Planner. Select the Cost Types drop down menu to toggle to another cost type. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. See Cost Type Settings to configure custom cost types. Here are some example use cases that may apply. Committed Hours would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. Timesheet Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type. NOTE: Resources must be assigned a role to import their timesheet hours into the resource plan. " },

You can toggle from one cost type to another. A cost type may be editable or not. If not, the data is likely being imported from another financial system for reference. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financials spent. " },

Currently, plan type permissions in OnePlan allow admins to set permissions on the plan type level to allow select Enterprise Security Groups the ability to create plans of that specific type.

This enhances governance, security, and collaboration. Go to the configuration pages. Go to the General settings area > Plan Types tab. Either create a new plan type or edit an existing plan type (see Create and Update Plan Types for instructions). In the Add\/Edit Plan Type form, go to the Security Tab . Click the Add Group button.

With the release of the Enterprise Security Group feature (released September 2023), there is an update to how permissions are assigned to resources in our APIs.

With the September 2023 release, \"GlobalPermissions\" will no longer be supported and will be removed. Instead, we will now be using \"OnePlanSecurityGroup\" property to assign the resource's security group. This property will accept the GUID value that represents the security group. To get your security groups' GUIDs, use the following query: https:\/\/my.oneplan.ai\/ApiHelp\/Api\/GET-api-securitygroups . The query will return list of security groups and search for the \"id\" property. In order to set \"None\" security group to a resource, you will need to set the \"OnePlanSecurityGroup\" property to an empty guid (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). If \"OnePlanSecurityGroup\" is set to null or if \"OnePlanSecurityGroup\" is not included in the API request body, the following will be applied: A default security group will be assigned only if you have a default security group selected in your OnePlan group settings Otherwise, the resource group will be \"None\" " },

With OnePlan Multi-Authentication, you can easily invite users to collaborate with you without requiring them to be added to your company's Office 365\/Azure Active Directory. These users can be contractors, customers, or whoever you would like to collaborate with who is outside of your company. By default, the Authentication Type is Office365 Strict , meaning only users in your Office365 tenant can access your OnePlan environment. You will need to enable Multi-Authentication if you would like to use this feature. Do not enable Multi-Authentication if you have external users set up in your Azure Active Directory. If you enable Multi-Authentication when you have external AD users, those external users will not be able to access OnePlan. To enable Multi-Authentication: Go to the Admin\/Config pages > Users > Authentication . In the Authentication Type drop-down, select Multi-Authentication . In the Allowed Authentications drop-down, select the allowed authentication methods. Options include Office365 , and Forms . Both Authentications are selected by default. Forms is a native OnePlan account that users can create and use to log into OnePlan. Likely, you will want to select both of these Authentications. However, if you are not using Office 365 as an Authentication, you can just select Forms . With Multi-Authentication enabled, when users go to OnePlan, they will now be able to login to OnePlan by entering their OnePlan account credentials into the Email and Password fields (if you have Forms as an Allowed Authentication ), or by using their Office365 credentials by clicking Sign in with Microsoft (if you have Office365 as an Allowed Authentication ). The login form will display regardless of the authentication method selected ( Office365 Strict or Multi-Authentication ). If you are using Office365 Strict , your users can simply click on Sign in with Microsoft to access OnePlan. Alternatively, you can send a link directly to your OnePlan environment via the Share With link. With Office365 Strict authentication, the Share With link will send users directly to the Microsoft login screen. " },

What are Cost Types? Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor what financial costs are planned, actually spent, and also financial gains. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply, for reference. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financial spend. " },

"body" : "On the Resource Plan settings page, expand the Types topic heading. The Cost Types page shows on both the Financial Plan and Resource Plan settings pages, regardless whether some cost types are only for financial or resource planning (or both). Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how your resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so organizations may analyze the differences. When multiple cost types are built, users can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply, for reference. The Committed Hours cost types would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed work\/tasks schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type.

Data entries from before the set date in all resource plans across all plans for the given cost type will be locked for editing. For example, if it is mid 2019 and all resource plan hours have been approved through July 2019, enter 7\/31\/2019. Everything through July will be locked\/un-editable. August 2019 and forward will still be editable. Lock Field : Select an applicable yes\/no plan-level field that will be used for locking the cost type, if needed. This method will only lock the resource plan for the given plan and cost type. This setting can be used in conjunction with the Calculations settings to create automations. For example, you can create a calculation for the plan that if State = Closed, then [the selected Lock Field] = true, thus locking the resource plan. Available Apps : Select whether the cost type should show in the Financial Plan, Resource Plan, or both. Import From: Select the source for import, if applicable. Options include: None Resource Planner ( [Cost Type]) : Allows users to import from one resource plan type to another (for example, scheduled, to committed). Timesheets: Allows users to import resource plan data from the Timesheets type. Resource Schedule: Allows users to import resource plan data from the Resource Schedule type. Includes all users who the plan is shared with. Resource Schedule (Assignments): Allows users to import resource plan data from the Resource Schedule type, but only includes users assigned tasks in the schedule. Status Date Lock: Check the check box to prevent import of data from resource plans prior to the set Status Date. Auto Import: Available when Import From is set to Resource Schedule or Timesheets . Check the check box to auto import the cost type to the set location. For Auto Import to function, you must setup the Cost Type Import schedule. See Enable automatic cost imports for instructions. Resource Schedule imports update in real time when the Auto Import box is checked. You do not need the Cost Type Import schedule set for this function to work. Plan Types: Select which plan types the cost type will apply to. " },

It does not map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to Actual Hours (Project). This is because the integration only supports mapping either % Complete or Actual Hours in Project Professional. Not both at the same time. If users want to map timesheet hours, our product recommendation is to map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to a custom field in Project Professional, in place of Actual Hours . Alternatively, users can remove the % Complete field in Project, and add in the Actual Hours field. Then they can map Timesheet Hours (OnePlan) to Actual Hours (Project). " },

"body" : "On the Resource Plan settings page, expand the Types topic heading. The Cost Types page shows on both the Financial Plan and Resource Plan settings pages, regardless whether some cost types are only for financial or resource planning (or both). Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how your resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so organizations may analyze the differences. When multiple cost types are built, users can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply, for reference. The Committed Hours cost types would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed work\/tasks schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. The Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type. " },

Set up 2 user accounts with owner\/admin permissions in the current (old) tenant. One as a user for the current tenant. One user will be migrated to the new tenant. We strongly recommend using 2 service accounts for this process. Update user GUIDS and emails if needed, except your admin user for the current tenant (from step 1a above). You can use the Resource API to update the Office365Id and email fields. This method is usually only recommended for large organizations with a lot of users. Migrate your new tenant admin user (from step 1b above) to the new tenant. For the new tenant admin user, swap out the Office365Id to match the new tenant Id. You will now have access to the new tenant once the admin user is migrated. Login to the new tenant and create a test OnePlan site. Contact OnePlan to update the Tenant Id.
