If you select the Programs Plan Type, only items in the second-level of the hierarchy (only Programs in this example) will be prioritized. If you expand the Programs, the child items (Projects, and Epics in this example) will not have prioritization numbers. If there are multiple plan types at the same level of the hierarchy, you can select all plan types at that level and prioritize them all at once. In this example, both Project and Epic Plan Types are selected. When Prioritization is turned on, both plan types are prioritized. When you switch to a Plan Type at a different level of the hierarchy, the prioritization numbering will reset. " },

If you remove the filter or go to another view, the prioritization will reset. For example, if you apply a Business Unit filter ( IT in this example) to the Projects and Epics Plan Type view, you will only see items that belong to the IT Business Unit, and the items will be prioritized based on the current view. If you remove the filter, the prioritization will reset based on the items' locations in the view. If you rearranged any items while the filter was applied, once you remove the filter the items will be positioned relative to where they were moved with the filter on. For example, Fabrikam ( prioritization number 3 to 4) was moved below VOIP Phones ( prioritization number 4 to 3) while the IT Business Unit filter was applied. Once the filter is removed, Fabrikam is still located right below VOIP Phones , but the prioritization numbers are different, and now based on their location relative to all of the other Projects and Epics in the view.

When you set the scheduling mode \/ task type at the plan level, all new tasks added to the plan will automatically be set to the selected scheduling mode \/ task type. There is also an Effort Driven setting that fixes the task effort value. When set, it tells the event to preserve its effort value and recalculate the other properties. Scheduling modes include: Normal : the task is scheduled based on information about its start \/ end dates. The effort (work hours) and assignment units (percentage usage of the resource assigned) are not calculated in this mode. This mode is always used for summary events. Do not enable the Effort Driven setting in this mode. Fixed Duration : the task has fixed start and end dates and duration, but its effort is computed dynamically based on the assigned resources. Changes to the effort will cause assignment units recalculation. Changes to the assignments will cause recalculation of the effort. Enabling the Effort Driven setting will force the task to always recalculate its assignment units whenever the task changes its duration or effort. Calculations provided by this mode work only if the event has at least one resource assigned. If you select Fixed Duration at the plan level (in the Default Task Type field), the Effort Driven setting will not be selected. Fixed Units : the task has fixed assignments and computed duration or effort. Changes to the effort will cause duration recalculation and changes to the duration will cause effort recalculation.

"body" : "Here we see Cost Types. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply. The Committed Hours cost type would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type.

"body" : "This article explains how the Resource Manager pre-filter works for users set as resource managers in OnePlan admin. Resource managers are off by default. To set up resource managers, see How do I set Resource Managers?. The resource manager pre-filter is a server-side filter that load resources into the Resource Plan area and\/or Resource Center area based on user permissions and Resource Managers admin settings. Owners and Managers Users with Owner or Manager permissions can view all resources in their OnePlan group, and can use the pre-filter to narrow down the list of resources in the Resource Plan area. The pre-filter is based on the Method set in the Resource Managers settings. For example, Owners or Managers who are set as resource managers using a Business Unit method, the users will see a Business Unit filter in the Resource Plan area. Contributors Users with Contributor permissions do not have access to other resources in their group. However, as a resource manager, Contributors can see the resources they manage in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area. For example, if a Contributor is designated as a resource manager for IT, they will be able to view all of the IT resources in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area. But, they cannot view any other resources. " },

There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply. Committed Hours would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type.

You can toggle from one cost type to another. A cost type may be editable or not. If not, the data is likely being imported from another financial system for reference. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financials spent. " },
